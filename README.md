Micropython Code for Georgetown Maker Hub's IOT Doorbell
Since it's only a doorbell, the only other 'cool' feature is that it posts uptime() to io.adafruit.com

The monitor uses the following components:
  - D1 Mini Wemos ESP8266 
  - Single Neopixel for Status
  - Simple push button

See accompanying Fritzing diagram for circuitry.
Still to do:
  - Make upgrade module *really* work.
